# Untrustworthy Data Feeds
The vulnerability known as oracle/price manipulation is related to the use of oracles as it stems from the lack of trust in external data sources. Attackers can provide inaccurate information through oracles to disrupt SC operations. In DeFi protocols, such attacks often involve flash loans, which let users borrow assets without collateral, as long as they are repaid within the same transaction block. Attackers exploit this by temporarily manipulating token prices on platforms such as Uniswap~\cite{UniswapProtocol}, making profits before prices can be corrected~\cite{mense2018security, kong2023defitainter}.
