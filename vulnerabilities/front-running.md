# Front running
Front-running, also known as Transaction-Ordering Dependency (TOD) [1], is a vulnerability stemming from the inherent concurrency issues within blockchain systems. In blockchains, the execution order of transactions depends on miners' decisions, typically influenced by transaction rewards. This opens the door for exploitation, where a malicious externally owned account (EOA) can manipulate the system by offering a higher gas price to prioritize their transaction. Additionally, a malicious miner can bypass gas price considerations entirely, prioritizing their own transactions to gain an unfair advantage. This behavior undermines the fairness and integrity of decentralized systems.
