# Ponzi
Ponzi contracts exploit design flaws, leading to vulnerabilities due to poor transparency, mismanagement, false promises of high returns, and legal non-compliance. These schemes often create an illusion of profitability by relying on the continuous influx of new investors, and the promised high returns are paid from the investments of newer participants rather than actual profits. This deceptive mechanism leads to financial loss for later investors and is marked by a lack of accountability and sustainability, ultimately resulting in the collapse of the system once the flow of new investments slows down or stops.
