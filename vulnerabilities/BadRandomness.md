# Bad Randomness
refers to vulnerabilities in smart contracts that rely on pseudo-random number generation using blockchain variables such as block.timestamp, block.difficulty, block.number, or blockhash. These variables are not truly random and can be manipulated, especially by miners, within a limited range. Such manipulation enables malicious actors to predict or alter outcomes in systems like lotteries, gambling, or other applications requiring randomness. For example, a lottery contract that uses block.timestamp as a seed for generating random numbers is susceptible to miners tweaking the timestamp to influence the results in their favor. This vulnerability compromises fairness, leads to financial losses, and undermines user trust in the affected applications [1].
