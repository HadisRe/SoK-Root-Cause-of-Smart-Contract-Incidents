# Ether Lost to Arphan Address
To execute an Ether transfer, it is essential to provide a valid 160-bit recipient address. If the address entered is invalid or corresponds to a non-existent account, the transaction will still proceed, but the transferred funds will become permanently inaccessible. This results in an irreversible loss, as the Ethereum network does not validate the existence or usability of the recipient address before completing the transfer.
## Toye Example
```Solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract EtherLostExample {
    function receiveEther() public payable {}

    function sendToInvalidAddress() public {

        address invalidAddress = 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD;

        address payable target = payable(invalidAddress);

        // ðŸ”´ Vulnerability: Sending Ether to an inaccessible address will permanently lock the funds
        target.transfer(address(this).balance); // Funds are sent here
    }
    function getBalance() public view returns (uint256) {
        return address(this).balance;
    }
}
```

## Real World Example
The article on BeInCrypto reports that the 0x0 address on the Ethereum network holds over $17 million worth of lost cryptocurrencies. This address, also known as the genesis address, contains over $2 million in Ether (ETH) and $15 million in various tokens. A significant portion of these funds was accidentally sent to this address, and due to the lack of access to the private key associated with this address, these cryptocurrencies are effectively considered lost forever [1].

In the early days of Ethereum, some miners mistakenly sent their mining rewards to this address because they failed to specify a recipient address. Today, this address is also used as a burner address, where users permanently destroy tokens by sending them to this address.

One real-world example of this type of vulnerability involves the EOS token smart contract [2,3], where more than 90,000 EOS tokens are stuck in the smart contract's own address. This issue arose due to poor contract design, which allowed users to send tokens to the smart contract's address without providing a mechanism to recover them. An example of a transfer function that exhibits this vulnerability is as follows:
```Solidity
function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public returns (bool) {
    // Transfer without destination address validation
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    balances[to] += amount;

    emit Transfer(msg.sender, to, amount);
    return true;
}
```
The vulnerability in this example lies in the lack of validation for the to address in the transfer function. Specifically, the following line of code introduces the issue:
```Solidity
balances[to] += amount;
```
Hereâ€™s why this is problematic:
- The function does not verify whether the to address is equal to the smart contract's own address. As a result, if the to address is mistakenly or intentionally set to the address of the contract itself, the tokens will be added to the contract's balance but cannot be retrieved due to the absence of a mechanism to withdraw them.
  
- Without proper validation, tokens transferred to the contract's address are effectively locked and lost.
