# Type casting
This vulnerability arises from improper type conversions in Solidity, particularly when casting between different integer types. For example, when a larger integer type like uint16 is cast to a smaller type like uint8, the excess bits are truncated, potentially leading to unexpected data loss. Another issue occurs when converting between signed and unsigned types of the same width, which can cause "signedness bugs." In such cases, negative values may be incorrectly interpreted as large positive numbers, or vice versa, leading to logical errors and unpredictable behavior in the contract.

## Toy Example
```Solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract TypeCastingVulnerabilityDemo {
    
    uint8 public smallNumber;

    // Function to set a large number and demonstrate truncation
    function setNumber(uint16 largeNumber) public {
        // Vulnerable line: Truncation occurs here
        smallNumber = uint8(largeNumber); // ðŸ”´ This line is vulnerable to truncation
    }
}
```

## Real World Example
In January 2022, a report titled "Unsafe uint128 Casting May Overflow" was published, highlighting a critical vulnerability in the Yield Protocol. This report emphasized the risks associated with improper type casting in the _calcRewardIntegral function, where frequent conversions between uint256 and uint128 were carried out without leveraging safe casting libraries such as SafeCast. These unsafe practices could potentially result in overflow issues, leading to inaccurate reward calculations and improper allocation of rewards to users. The affected contract includes reward calculation and distribution logic for users who stake assets. Its functionality heavily relies on precise mathematical computations to ensure accurate distribution. However, due to unsafe casting practices, the contract exposes itself to logical errors and inconsistencies.In the following sections, we will analyze the vulnerable points in the contract and provide insights into the potential risks and their mitigations [1,2].

- calcRewardIntegral Function: The line responsible for calculating the rewardIntegral in this function contains a type overflow vulnerability. Specifically, the computation ((bal - rewardRemaining) * 1e20) / _supply is directly cast to uint128. If the result exceeds the maximum value for uint128 (2^128 - 1), an overflow will occur, leading to incorrect reward calculations and improper reward distribution among users. This issue can be mitigated by using the SafeCast library to safely convert the value, ensuring no overflow occurs. For example:
```Solidity
rewardIntegral = uint128(rewardIntegral) + uint128(((bal - rewardRemaining) * 1e20) / _supply);
```
- calcCvxIntegral Function: This function contains another overflow risk in the line that computes cvxRewardIntegral. The operation (d_cvxreward * 1e20) may exceed the bounds of a uint256 if d_cvxreward is a large value, leading to logical errors in CVX reward calculations. The use of SafeMath functions for multiplication and division ensures the operation is safely executed without overflow. For instance:

```Solidity
cvxRewardIntegral = SafeMath.add(cvxRewardIntegral, SafeMath.div(SafeMath.mul(d_cvxreward, 1e20), _supply));
```

- checkpointAndClaim Function: In this function, the call to _calcRewardIntegral lacks proper validation or error handling. If _calcRewardIntegral encounters an issue, such as a failure in reward calculation, the error propagates without being addressed. This can result in incorrect rewards for users. To prevent such scenarios, it is crucial to validate the success of _calcRewardIntegral by adding a require statement:

```Solidity
require(_calcRewardIntegral(i, _accounts, depositedBalance, supply, true), "Reward calculation failed");
```

- earned Function: The reward calculation in the earned function involves dividing by constants like 1e20. If _supply or 1e20 is improperly initialized or zero, the division operation can cause runtime errors or incorrect reward calculations. To mitigate this, a pre-check should be added to ensure _supply is greater than zero before proceeding with the computation:

```Solidity
require(_supply > 0, "Supply must be greater than zero");

```
- setApprovals Function: The use of maximum allowance (type(uint256).max) for ERC-20 token approvals in this function poses a significant security risk. If the convexBooster or convexPool contracts are compromised, malicious actors could exploit the infinite approval to drain tokens. To enhance security, the approvals should be set to specific and context-aware allowance values, determined by the actual requirements of the operations. For example:

```Solidity
uint256 allowance = calculateAllowance();
IERC20(curveToken).approve(convexBooster, allowance);
IERC20(convexToken).approve(convexPool, allowance);
```
